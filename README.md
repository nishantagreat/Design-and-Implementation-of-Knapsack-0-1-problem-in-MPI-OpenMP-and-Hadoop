This project aims to put into practice the knowledge gained during the semester in the Parallel and Distributed Processing course. I choose to work on the 0/1 Knapsack problem, and to implement two solutions using parallelism to solve this problem. This subject has been chosen since I wanted to work on a programming project to gain skills and practice on parallel implementation methods learnt during the semester. The 0/1 knapsack problem seemed to be a good subject as it was a problem on which I have never worked before, and seemed to be understandable and interesting. I have produce 3 programs and compare their efficiency.I have analyzed and understand the 0/1 knapsack problem and find a sequential algorithm. Then, I have worked to design and implement a MPI based solution, openMP based solution and a Hadoop based solution.
